// This is not a real file that will be created, just a reference for how the AuthContext should be modified.
// We cannot directly modify the read-only AuthContext.tsx file, but this shows what needs to be changed:

// The User type should be imported from our custom definition instead of from Supabase
// import { User } from '@supabase/supabase-js';  <- This should be removed
// import type { User } from '../types/supabase'; <- This should be added instead
